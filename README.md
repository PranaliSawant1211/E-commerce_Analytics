ECOM CONNECT: E-commerce Analytics

E-commerce has become a cornerstone of modern business, generating vast amounts of data from customer interactions, product sales, and logistics operations. This project, ECOM CONNECT, was designed to harness the power of data to drive smarter decision-making for e-commerce businesses. Using a dataset that included customer details, orders, product categories, sales, shipping details, and delivery statuses, I built an analytics solution to provide actionable insights. This project aimed to enhance resource planning, improve marketing strategies, and optimize operational efficiency by analyzing key metrics and trends in customer demand, sales performance, and logistics.

The solution was built using Google BigQuery to process and analyze the e-commerce data efficiently. I implemented SQL-based analytics to uncover insights into sales trends, customer growth, product performance, and delivery efficiency. The findings were presented through an interactive 4-page dashboard in Power BI, with dedicated sections for Customers, Orders, Products, and Shipping & Logistics.

The dashboard includes KPIs like Order Fulfillment Rate, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Order Frequency, Customer Repeat Rate, Profit Margin, and Average Delivery Time. Each page was tailored to meet specific analytical needs:

Customers Page: Focused on customer behavior and segmentation, highlighting CLV, repeat purchase rates, and engagement trends.

Orders Page: Presented sales performance, order trends, and profitability metrics, enabling insights into revenue growth.

Products Page: Detailed product performance metrics, such as top-selling products, profitability, and category contributions.

Shipping & Logistics Page: Evaluated delivery efficiency with metrics like On-Time Delivery Rate, Late Delivery Rate, and Average Delivery Time.

This project demonstrates how data can be transformed into actionable insights for improving customer experience, optimizing operations, and driving business growth. By combining SQL, Google BigQuery, and an intuitive dashboard design, I delivered a comprehensive analytics solution that bridges the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making.
